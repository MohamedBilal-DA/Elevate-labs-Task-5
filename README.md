# 🚢 Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the famous **Titanic dataset** to uncover key patterns and insights related to passenger survival.  
The goal is to demonstrate **data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling with EDA** before moving into predictive modeling.

## ⚡ Key Highlights
- Cleaned and explored **418 rows × 12 columns**
- Handled missing values in `Age`, `Fare`, and `Cabin`
- Engineered new features like **Family Size, Title, and Deck**
- Visualized distributions, correlations, and survival patterns
- Generated insights on **class, gender, age, and fare impact on survival**

## 🔍 Findings
- Women had significantly higher survival rates than men  
- Younger passengers (especially children) had better chances of survival  
- Wealthier passengers (higher fare / 1st class) were more likely to survive  
- Most passengers embarked from port **S**, but survival was higher for port **C**  
- Socio-economic status played a critical role in survival  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Reporting**: ReportLab (for PDF)
